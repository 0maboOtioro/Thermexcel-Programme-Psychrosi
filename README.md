  Thermexcel Programme Psychrosi: A Tool for Psychrometric Calculations 
Psychrometry is the study of the properties and processes of moist air. It is essential for many applications in engineering, meteorology, agriculture, and human comfort. However, psychrometric calculations can be complex and tedious, especially when dealing with mixtures of air and water vapor, or when considering different types of humidification and cooling processes.

Fortunately, there is a tool that can simplify and automate these calculations: Thermexcel Programme Psychrosi. This is a software program developed by Thermexcel, a company that specializes in providing solutions for thermal engineering. Thermexcel Programme Psychrosi is an Excel-based program that can perform psychrometric calculations for the humid air, according to two input elements, such as dry temperature and relative humidity, dry temperature and wet temperature, dry temperature and specific moisture, dry temperature and enthalpy, relative humidity and specific moisture, or specific moisture and enthalpy. The program can also calculate the psychrometric properties of the air after different types of humidification and cooling processes, such as adiabatic humidification by water spraying or steam injection. Moreover, the program can handle psychrometric calculations for swimming pools, as well as for mixtures of air with constant specific moisture.
 
Thermexcel Programme Psychrosi is a user-friendly and versatile tool that can help engineers, technicians, students, and researchers to perform accurate and efficient psychrometric calculations. The program can be downloaded for free from the Thermexcel website, where you can also find more information about the features and functions of the program. You can also watch a video demonstration of the program on YouTube, or read a detailed presentation of the program in PDF format.

If you are interested in psychrometry and want to save time and effort in your calculations, you should definitely try Thermexcel Programme Psychrosi. It is a powerful and reliable tool that can help you to understand and manipulate the properties and processes of moist air.
